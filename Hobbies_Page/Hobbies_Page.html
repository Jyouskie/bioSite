            Frank doesn’t have to much free time on his hands during this fullstack bootcamp, but when he does he enjoys
            playing video games, reading, and baking. Some of the video games he likes to play are Age of empires 3, Men
            of war: Assault Squad Two, and halo. Age of empires 3 came out in 2005, but they just released a remastered
            edition last year that he has transition to. They game is RTS or real time strategy game that is set during
            the imperial age of the world. He has competed in many world tournaments and has taken placed 2nd a couple
            of times. The second game he enjoys is Men of War, this is also a RTS game that is set during World War Two.
            This game came out in 2014 and still to this day is a very relevant World War Two game. Lastly Halo, one of
            the all-time best game franchises, he remembers the day of dominating in halo 2-3 when the game was in its
            hay day. For people who don’t know halo is a FPS or first person shooter that is set in the future. The
            original storyline you are a super solider that must save earth and fight against alien invaders that came
            to take over earth. He currently plays halo infinite which is the 6th installment of the franchise.

        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p class="books">
            When frank gets the chance he enjoys picking up a good book and reading it on the patio in the warm southern
            California sun. His all-time favorite book the Count of Monte Cristo. The book takes place during the period
            of 1815-1839 in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean. The time period its set in was a historical
            time in France, the era of Bourbon Restoration. The next two weren’t really books them selves but series.
            The first series he enjoyed was The Lord of the Rings series. It was a 3 book series The Fellowship of the
            Rings, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King. These books were written by J.R.R Tolkien and was a
            sequel to his first book the Hobbit, but later turned into what it is now. The third and final series that
            he enjoyed to read was the Game Of Thrones series. It was written by Gorge R.R. Martian and is a fictional
            story that takes place in Westeros, the author based the world off of medieval Britain. There are 5 books in
            the series with another one on the way in the near future (fans have been waiting for years for it).

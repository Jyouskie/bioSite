    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="Paragraph">
        <p>Frank Kromer was born in North Carolina where he was raised for a few short years before him and his family
            moved up to Cleveland Ohio. He lived in Cleveland for most of grade school before moving to Sandusky Ohio,
            this is
            where the story begins. Frank went to Sandusky Central Catholic high school where he graduated and decided
            to follow in his brother’s footsteps to join the Navy. He joined the Navy right out of high school because
            he
            really didn’t really know what he wanted to do with his life just yet and didn’t want to waste money trying
            to figure that out at an expensive college. He worked at battery park marina before going to bootcamp where
            he
            grew close to one of his older brother’s friends and eventually became one of his best friends. His favorite
            memory of working there would be painting curbs with him and talking about what video game they were going
            to play
            later that night. After spending some years in the navy, he eventually got out of the Navy and went to
            college
            at Cleveland State University. He got his degree in accounting but through internships he felt it was dull
            and
            not for him. After some soul searching, he talking to family and friends and decided to pivot his career
            choice
            into tech. He packed everything up and went west to San Diego where his older brother lives and is currently
            enrolled in a full stack bootcamp. While at this bootcamp he has found it more stratifying, challenging and
            engaging then accounting. He is set to graduate in March of 2023 and will be looking to get his foot in the
            door somewhere so can show off the skills he has acquired over the very intensive bootcamp that he
            completed.
